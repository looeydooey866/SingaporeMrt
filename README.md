# SingaporeMrt
A program that calculates the shortest path of travel from one MRT station to another.

# Usage
Enter two lowercase MRT station names (spaces removed) in the following format: ```[MRT Station 1] [MRT Station 2]```, and the program will output the estimated total trip time and all of the MRT stations visited on the shortest path. Do note that the program does not take into account of factors such as waiting time and time taken when switching between lines.
